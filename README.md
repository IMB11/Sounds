# Sonance

Sonance is an interactive sound overhaul mod, it is inspired by [Effective](https://modrinth.com/mod/effective) and is partially feature-complete compared to [ExtraSounds](https://modrinth.com/mod/extrasounds).

The high configurability of Sonance, and it's super intuitive configuration screen is thanks to [Yet Another Config Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)

## Sounds

All sounds in Sonance can be configured to be dynamic, Sonance will use properties such as the item or block type to determine a suitable sound.

You can also configure the default pitch and volume of the sound, or whether the sound should be enabled in the first place.

Currently, Sonance has the following sounds available:

<details>
<summary>Pick Block</summary>

When you use the "Pick Block" keybind, a sound effect will play. This sound is dynamic by default - so the properties of the block you have selected will determine what sound will play.
